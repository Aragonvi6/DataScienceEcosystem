###Arithmetic expressions
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
Integer Division (//): Returns the floor division of the left operand by the right operand (removes the decimal part).
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
Exponentiation (**): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
