### Arithmetic expressions
1.Addition (+): Adds two operands.
2.Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
3.Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
4.Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
5.Integer Division (//): Returns the floor division of the left operand by the right operand (removes the decimal part).
6.Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
7.Exponentiation (**): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
